This is my first project as a beginner stage web development aprentice.
I apologize for my English, I'm a colombian Business Admin student, but 
passionate for coding. I've learned a lot thanks to this free online 
resources. I hope eventually I get to the level I want to be. 
With this project I plan to put into practice all the HTML and CSS
I've been able to learn so far.
